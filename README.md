## 🧠 STORY MODE

I don’t just write code —  
I design **flows**, **logic**, and **experiences**.

My background in **Systems Engineering** and **UX thinking** allows me to connect
user needs with solid technical solutions, focusing on clarity, usability, and structure.

I believe good software feels intuitive before it feels complex.
