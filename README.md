## 🗺️ The Realm

I design software the way strong kingdoms survive:  
with clarity, structure, and foresight.

My background in Systems Engineering and UX thinking allows me to connect
user needs with solid technical solutions, focusing on usability,
maintainability, and long-term scalability.

I don’t just write code.  
I design flows, logic, and experiences.

Good software feels intuitive before it feels complex.
